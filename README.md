# Development of a Tool to Analyze, Improve, Predict Success and Identify Current Trends in Short Videos for Social Media Using Machine Learning Technologies and Neural Networks
The emergence of short videos on social media has caused a sharp increase in user engagement. An entire industry has developed in this direction, with many people and companies gaining popularity and making money by using this technology to promote their product. The development of this industry has caused a sharp increase in the number of content creators, and this has increased competition. In conditions of high competence, content creators are forced to develop new scenarios and ideas for short videos, as well as carefully monitor trends. It is becoming increasingly difficult to track trends manually and assess the potential popularity of videos based solely on the personal experience of a content creator. This study developed several tools that will help optimize the work of content creators and possibly reduce the budget spent by companies on creating short videos to promote their products. The developed tools allows to evaluate the potential popularity of a short video, as well as monitor current trends in this industry.
